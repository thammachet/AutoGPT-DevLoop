Welcome to the ChatGPT Command Prompt Controller!
Type your high-level goals below. Type 'exit', 'quit', or 'q' to quit.
You: Build a GUI that lets the user select an image file via a ‘Browse’ button. Use OpenCV to detect faces in the image, draw bounding boxes around them, and display or pop up the processed image. Automatically install opencv-python (or similar) as needed. The user interactions (browse, detect, display) should be entirely in the GUI, and you should log the file path selected, the number of faces detected, and any errors.
