You: Create a GUI chat window where the user can type messages in a text box and press ‘Send.’ The chatbot replies with pre-defined or knowledge-base-driven responses, which are displayed in a scrollable conversation area. The knowledge base may be a local text or JSON file. The application should auto-install any required libraries, not rely on terminal input, and log each user query, the chatbot’s reply, and any environment actions.
