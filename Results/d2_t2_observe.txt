Type your high-level goals below. Type 'exit', 'quit', or 'q' to quit.
You: Design a GUI program that manages a shopping list. It should have a text field to enter an item name, plus buttons to ‘Add Item,’ ‘Remove Item,’ ‘View List,’ and ‘Exit.’ The list should be stored in a local file (e.g., .txt or .csv). When the user clicks ‘View List,’ show the current shopping list in a text area or pop-up. No command-line input is permitted, and all required steps (file I/O, environment setup) must be handled automatically, with logs capturing each operation.

Assistant: The GUI shopping‑list manager is ready:

• main.py
  – Tkinter window with “Add Item”, “Remove Item”, “View List” and “Exit” buttons
  – Stores entries in shopping_list.txt
  – Logs every operation to app.log

To launch it:
1. Activate the project’s virtual environment (venv)
2. Run:
   python main.py
