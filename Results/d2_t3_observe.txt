You: Create a GUI-based expense tracker with fields for date, description, and amount. The user clicks ‘Add Expense’ to store a record in a CSV file, and can also click ‘View Total’ to see the sum of all expenses. Show the total in a pop-up or label. The program should install dependencies on its own and must not rely on terminal inputs. Log each new entry and the total expense whenever requested.

Execution successful.
**Output**:

Assistant: Your expense tracker is all set. Since tkinter is part of the standard Python library, you don’t need to install it with pip. To run the app:

1. Open a terminal and go into the project folder:
   `cd expense_tracker`

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   • On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
   • On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Launch the GUI:
   `python expense_tracker.py`

A window will pop up where you can add expenses and view the total. All entries and totals are logged to expense_tracker.log.
You: exit
Goodbye!
