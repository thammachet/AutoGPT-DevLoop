• venv/  
  – Virtual environment containing Python and installed libraries (tkinter comes with the standard library).

• jokes.json  
  – A small JSON array of five jokes.

• main.py  
  – A Tkinter‑based GUI that loads jokes.json, displays a “Get Joke” button (picks and shows a random joke, logs each click and the joke text to jokes.log) and an “Exit” button to close the window.

• jokes.log  
  – Written at runtime, with timestamped entries like  
    “2023‑06‑15 12:34:56 – Displayed joke: What do you call fake spaghetti? An impasta.”

You can run the application by launching main.py in the venv; all interaction happens through the GUI. Let me know if you’d like any changes or additions!",True,,127.636
