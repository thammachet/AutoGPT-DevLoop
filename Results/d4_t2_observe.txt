Type your high-level goals below. Type 'exit', 'quit', or 'q' to quit.
You: Develop a GUI-based PDF merger. The user clicks a button to select multiple PDF files (allow multi-file selection), then clicks ‘Merge PDFs’ to create a single merged PDF. Display a progress bar or status messages during the merge, and let the user specify where to save the final PDF. Required packages (e.g., PyPDF2) must be installed autonomously, and you should log each file path selected, the merge process, and the result. No terminal prompts are allowed.
