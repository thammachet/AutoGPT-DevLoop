Type your high-level goals below. Type 'exit', 'quit', or 'q' to quit.
You: Create a GUI-based word frequency analyzer. The user can either paste text into a text box or click a ‘Browse’ button to select a .txt file. When they click ‘Process,’ the program calculates and displays the top N most frequent words in a scrollable area or pop-up. Libraries (e.g., nltk) must be installed automatically, and user interactions (file chosen, text pasted, top words) should be logged. No command-line usage is permitted.

Assistant: All set—your GUI word‐frequency analyzer is ready. The virtual environment “venv” has nltk installed, and the main script with logging is in place. To run it, just activate “venv” and launch main.py (e.g. double‑click or “python main.py” from the venv); the window will let you paste text or browse for a .txt, then display the top N words. Let me know if you’d like any tweaks!

**Output**:

Assistant: It looks like the Process button didn’t trigger any action—likely because the GUI’s paste binding cancels the default paste, or the pop-up isn’t appearing. Let’s add debug prints and ensure the button callback fires.

I’ll update the button and logging to confirm:
- Add a console print/log right at the start of process_text().
- Verify that the Process button command is correctly bound.
After changes, I’ll rerun to test.
