Since tkinter is part of the standard Python library, you don’t need to install it with pip. To run the app:

1. Open a terminal and go into the project folder:  
   `cd expense_tracker`

2. Activate the virtual environment:  
   • On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`  
   • On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Launch the GUI:  
   `python expense_tracker.py`

A window will pop up where you can add expenses and view the total. All entries and totals are logged to expense_tracker.log.",True,,207.181
