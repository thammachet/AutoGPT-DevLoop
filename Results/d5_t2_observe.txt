You: Build a small machine learning demo that trains a classifier (e.g., on the Iris dataset) and then accepts user inputs for features (like sepal length/width) via a GUI or minimal web interface. When the user clicks ‘Predict,’ it shows the predicted class (e.g., Iris setosa). Libraries such as scikit-learn should be installed without manual intervention. No command-line usage is allowed. Log all user inputs, model predictions, and environment details.
