How to run it:
1. Activate the virtual environment in `weather_gui_app`:
   - On Windows:
     `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS/Linux:
     `source venv/bin/activate`
2. Launch the app:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
3. In the window that appears, paste your OpenWeatherMap API key, enter a city name or ZIP code, and click **Get Weather**.

All queries and full JSON responses are logged to `weather.log`.
You: exit

Assistant: Your GUI is ready. Set OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY (or replace the placeholder), then launch it with:

    python main.py

All queries and responses are logged to weather.log. Let me know if you’d like any tweaks.
You: I don't know how to set API Key, Only have the key. What can I do?
Assistant: You have two easy options:

1) Set the API key as an environment variable.
   • On Windows (CMD):
     ```
     setx OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY "YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY"
     ```
     (You’ll need to close and re‑open any consoles so the new variable takes effect.)
   • On macOS/Linux (bash or zsh):
     ```bash
     export OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY"
     ```
     Then launch your GUI from that same shell session:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

2) Hard‑code it into the script.
   • Open weather_gui/main.py, find the line
     ```python
     API_KEY = os.getenv('OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY', 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE')
     ```
     and replace `'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'` with your actual key, e.g.:
     ```python
     API_KEY = 'abcd1234yourkeyhere'
     ```

After either step, rerun `python main.py`. The app will pick up your key and begin fetching data.
You: Please make the input in the GUI for input the API Key
