You: Develop a GUI-based quiz that generates random multiplication questions (e.g., ‘3 × 5’). The user should see one question at a time and enter their answer in a text field. Upon clicking ‘Submit,’ the quiz checks correctness, updates the score, and displays the next question if requested. At the end, show the final score. The application should install libraries on its own, run without terminal input, and log user actions (answers, final score, etc.).

Assistant: The GUI quiz is now ready. Just activate the virtual environment, launch `quiz.py`, and you’ll get a window asking 10 random “a × b” questions in sequence. As you go it:

- auto‑logs every answer and the final score into `quiz.log`
- shows “Correct!”/“Incorrect!” feedback
- lets you click “Next Question” until the quiz ends, then displays your total score

To try it:

1. On Windows:
   • Open PowerShell in the `multiplication_quiz` folder
   • `.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
   • `python quiz.py`

2. On macOS/Linux:
   • `source venv/bin/activate`
   • `python quiz.py`

Feel free to double‑click `quiz.py` once the venv is active; no terminal input is required. Let me know if you’d like any tweaks!
You: exit
