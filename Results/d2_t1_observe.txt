You: Implement a GUI application that converts a small image (approximately 100×100 or less) into ASCII art. Provide a ‘Browse’ button so the user can select an image file. After conversion, display the ASCII art in a scrollable text widget or a pop-up. Ensure any image-processing libraries (like Pillow) are installed automatically, and record logs of file selection, processing time, and conversion output. The application must not use terminal prompts—only GUI components.

Using cached pillow-11.2.1-cp312-cp312-win_amd64.whl (2.7 MB)
Installing collected packages: Pillow
Successfully installed Pillow-11.2.1

Assistant: The GUI image‑to‑ASCII converter is now in place:

- “Browse Image” button opens a file dialog
- Automatically installs Pillow if missing
- Converts to ASCII, logs file path, timing and output to ascii_art_gui.log
- Displays result in a scrollable window

To try it, activate the venv and run main.py. Let me know if you’d like any tweaks!

Assistant: The GUI application is ready. To try it out:

1. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

2. Run the converter:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

A window will open with a “Browse” button. Select any small image (up to ~100×100), and the ASCII art will appear in the scrollable text area. Processing details (file selected, time taken, ASCII output) are logged to ascii_art_gui.log in the project folder.
