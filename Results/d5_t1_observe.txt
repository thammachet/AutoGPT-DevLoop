You: Implement a mini web application using Flask. Provide an HTML form where users can upload an image. The server converts the image to ASCII art and displays it on a results page or makes it downloadable as a .txt file. Run in a fresh environment, automatically installing Flask and image libraries. Do not rely on terminal inputs for user interaction. Log each upload, processing time, and final ASCII output status.
